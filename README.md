The game that I will be creating is called TAMAGOTCHI

<Game's Title> Tamagotchi

<Technologies Used> I am using HTML, CSS, Javascript.

<Getting Started>
    Link to the game: 


    Instructions in how to play the game:
        One day, You found a random EGG in the middle of the road!
        There is no one else around you, so you pick up the egg and take it back to your home and begin to take care of the egg.

        The goal of this game is to continue to feed your "Pet" as time goes on as long as you can. 
        Through the stages, you will need to continue to take care of your pet by:
            - Feeding Food
            - Sleeping
            - Cleaning up after they poop
            - Exercising
            - Playing games
            - Abandoning your Tamagotchi (But why would you choose to do this?)

If you hover your mouse over the "Menu", you will gain the ability to choose what action you would want to take to your Tamagotchi
(Abandon option is indicated in red - because why would you?)
