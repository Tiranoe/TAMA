<Technologies Used> I am using HTML, CSS, Javascript.

<Getting Started>
    Link to the game: 


    Instructions in how to play the game:
        One day, You found a random EGG in the middle of the road!
        There is no one else around you, so you pick up the egg and take it back to your home and begin to take care of the egg.

        The goal of this game is to continue to feed your "Pet" as time goes on as long as you can. 
        Through the stages, you will need to continue to take care of your pet by:
            - Feeding Food
            - Sleeping
            - Cleaning up after they poop
            - Exercising
            - Playing games
            - Abandoning your Tamagotchi (But why would you choose to do this?)




<Next Steps>
    - Here is the wireframe used to plan the game

    - Also made a map of how the interaction between user and code will be like

    ***Figure out the time variable on how long user needs to play to complete the game, and also amount of time tamagotchi has before dying without attention.

    Menu option(?)
        - how the user can access the options of what to do with Tamagotchi
